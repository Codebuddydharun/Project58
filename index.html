          <h1>About</h1>
    
    <p>My hobby is to read whether it is a newspaper, a news, a novel, a GK book or an informative book written by any good writer.

I always read story books, newspapers, magazines, and any other material that I find interesting in my spare time.

This my hobby of reading books was noticed by my father for the first time and he inspired me by saying that it is a very good habit to be given naturally to my son, never take away this habit and put it into practice.

I was just a little boy and I was very interested in reading fairy tales and other stories given by my parents.

Now I am 11 years old and study in 7th grade, now I really know the benefits of my reading habit.

This enables me to gain all general knowledge about any subject and this habit has learned me about the wonders of the world, the history of the origin of life, space, animals, plants, aquatic animals, human achievements and other fascinating things about the world.</p>
